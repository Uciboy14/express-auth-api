# 🌐 Express Authentication & Authorization API

Welcome to the **Express Authentication & Authorization API** project! This backend API is designed to showcase my skills in building robust, secure, and scalable RESTful APIs using **Node.js** and **Express.js**. The project features user authentication and role-based authorization, making it ideal for modern web applications that require secure access control.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a RESTful API with key functionalities including:

- **User Registration**: Secure sign-up process with password hashing.
- **User Login**: Authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Protected Routes**: Role-based access control to protect sensitive resources.
- **User Profile Management**: Access to user-specific data after authentication.

This API is the backbone of any modern web application where user management and security are paramount.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Node.js**: A powerful JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing user data.
- **Mongoose**: An elegant MongoDB object modeling tool.
- **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens for secure user authentication.
- **Bcrypt**: For hashing user passwords before storing them in the database.


## 🌟 Features

- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication to manage user sessions.
- **Password Hashing**: User passwords are securely hashed using Bcrypt before being stored.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different levels of access are provided based on user roles.
- **API Documentation**: Easy-to-follow API documentation with endpoints and expected responses.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/uciboy14/express-auth-api.git
   cd express-auth-api
   ```

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following:
    ```makefile
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret


3. **Run the server:**
    ```bash
    nodemon server.js
    ```


## ⚙️ Test the API

Use Postman or any API testing tool to interact with the endpoints.

## 📚 API Documentation

Here's a brief overview of the available endpoints:

### **User Authentication**

- **Register**: `POST /api/auth/signup`
  - Register a new user with username, email, and password.

- **Login**: `POST /api/auth/login`
  - Authenticate a user and return a JWT token.

### **Protected Routes**

- **Get User**: `GET /api/auth/user`
  - Retrieve the authenticated user's profile. (Requires JWT)

## 🧪 Testing

- Comprehensive testing with tools like Postman.
- Ensure secure and smooth operation of authentication flows.
